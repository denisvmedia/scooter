# place and `.envrc` (`use flake`) / `nix develop` share it.

# Deliberately a plain `mkShell` (not devenv.sh): this repo pins a SINGLE nixpkgs
# (see flake.nix) that the sandbox image, its lazy-tool stubs, and the runtime
# re-converge all resolve against. A separate devenv input would add its own
# nixpkgs surface; keeping the shell on the flake's pkgs avoids that drift.
